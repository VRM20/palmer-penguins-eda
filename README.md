# 🐧 Palmer Penguins - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization project using the **Palmer Penguins dataset**. This project explores biological measurements and species data for three penguin species across different islands in Antarctica.

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Univariate and multivariate analysis of penguin traits
- Comparative visualizations across **species**, **islands**, **sex**, and **years**
- Clear pattern discovery using:
  - Histograms, Boxplots, Violin plots
  - Scatter plots, Pairplots, KDE, Heatmaps
  - Interactive Plotly charts
- Clean conclusions written for every chart
- Ready for academic or portfolio use

## 📂 Dataset Info

This project uses the [`palmerpenguins`]([https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data)) dataset:
> The data includes size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

Features:
- **Species**: Adelie, Gentoo, Chinstrap
- **Island**: Torgersen, Biscoe, Dream
- **Culmen (Beak) Length & Depth**
- **Flipper Length**
- **Body Mass**
- **Sex**, **Year**, and more

## 📊 Visualizations Included

| Chart | Insight |
|-------|---------|
| Pie charts | Species, island, and sex distributions |
| Histograms & KDE | Body mass and other numeric features |
| Scatter plots | Culmen & flipper relationships by species |
| Heatmap | Correlation between features |
| Violin & Boxplots | Feature variation by species and sex |
| Swarm, Strip, Bubble plots | Detailed distribution analysis |
| Pairplot | Feature interaction across species |

---

## 🧠 Key Findings

- **Gentoo penguins** are the largest in size and weight.
- **Adelie penguins** are the most widely distributed across islands.
- **Species are separable** using culmen length, depth, and flipper size.
- Body mass is highly correlated with flipper length.
- No major outliers detected — the dataset is clean and consistent.

(Full conclusions are written below each chart in the notebook.)
